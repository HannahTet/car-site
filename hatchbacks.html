   	<h1>What model of hatchback worth buying?</h1>
    <p>Many people ask this question when they decide to buy a hatchback. Today car manufacturers offer a big variety of    		hatchbacks, and for an ordinary driver (especially for a woman) it is quite difficult to make such a decision.
        In our site we made a review of most popular hatchback models in Israel. We hope this information will help you to understand all technical characteristics while choosing a hatchback, and afterwards you'll  be able to buy the car of your dream.<br><br>
        When starting the search of the car we should think of some points, such as:
        <ol>
        	<li><h4><a href="#engine" class="read">the power of engine;</a></h4></li>
        	<li><h4><a href="#devices" class="read">electronic system & devices;</a></h4></li>
        	<li><h4><a href="#design" class="read">the design of the car;</a></h4></li>
        	<li><h4><a href="#safety" class="read">safety system;</a></h4></li>
        	<li><h4><a href="#fuel" class="read">fuel consumption and exhaust level;</a></h4></li>
        	<li><h4><a href="#size" class="read">size and comfort;</a></h4></li>
        	<li><h4><a href="#origin" class="read">age and origin;</a></h4></li>
        	<li><h4><a href="#insurance" class="read">car and driver insurance.</a></h4></li>
        </ol></p>
        <a id="engine" class="read"><h3>The power of engine</h3></a><br>
        <p>If it's not important for you whether hatchback is fast or not, then the engine of 1,2 - 1,6L is enough. But if you adore high speed driving, you need to look for a car with 3L turbo engine.</p>
         <p class="top"><a href="#top" class="read">Back to top</a></p>
	    <a id="devices" class="read"><h3>Electronic system & devices</h3></a><br>
        <p>Today one can't imagine his/her car without climate control, a digital display with mini computer and so on. More over, every year there are new abilities of the electronic system &#40for example, automatic braking when the distance between your car and the car before is less than it should be according to the rules of traffic movement&#41.</p>
         <p class="top"><a href="#top" class="read">Back to top</a></p>
         <a id="design" class="read"><h3>The design of the car</h3></a><br>
        <p>The esthetic view of the car has big influence on many buyers: modern forms and colours of the salon, materials used in it, cosy seats etc. make driver's life more comfortable, bacause many of them spend much time in the car, and some of them call their car the second home. Besides, every model has a variety of car accessories that can be ordered according to a buyer taste.</p>
         <p class="top"><a href="#top" class="read">Back to top</a></p>
         <a id="safety" class="read"><h3>Safety system</h3></a><br>
         <p>The amount of air bags is very important for all cars. We should also pay attention to the strength of the cabin. We need these two points to understand the health risk level of the driver and tha passengers in case of a car accident.</p>
         <p class="top"><a href="#top" class="read">Back to top</a></p>
         <a id="fuel" class="read"><h3>Fuel consumption and exhaust level</h3></a><br>
         <p>It is a well known fact that small cars use 5-6 liters of fuel per 100 km in average. The consumption of big cars is 12-15 liters per 100 km contrary. But  car manufacturers went forward this way, and today it is possible to buy a car with a powerful engine that does not consump fuel more than its small "friend".<br> As to the types of fuel it can be petrol or diesel. The difference between them is that diesel more torque at low speeds and produces approximately 13% more CO2 gas per gallon of fuel burned, compared to petrol &#40;gas&#41; engines. The price is also different in each country.<br> When talking about exaustion, it should be mentioned that today there are many models that are ecological, hybrids, and have two systems of consumption - fuel and electricity</p>
         <p class="top"><a href="#top" class="read">Back to top</a></p>
         <a id="size" class="read"><h3>Size and comfort</h3></a><br>
         <p>Some drivers prefer to buy short length cars because they believe it will help them to park in any urbanic place that has countless quantity of cars. But in short hatchbacks the boot will not fit to all needs of a big family.</p>
         <p class="top"><a href="#top" class="read">Back to top</a></p>
         <a id="origin" class="read"><h3>Age and origin</h3></a><br>
         <p>If you are interested in a new car, it is enough to choose the car manufacturer you trust and to buy a car. But if you cannot afford to buy an expensive car, then you shoud spend much more time looking for the car of your dream. This is because you will need to compare the prices of second hand vehicles, the amount of km that a certain car did, the condition of the car accoding to its age etc.<br>As to the origin we should say there are 10 countries that produce the hatchbacks we present:
           <ul>
               <li>Japan &#40;Suzuki, Seat, Toyota, Mazda, Nissan, Subaru, Mitsubishi, Honda&#41;;</li>
               <li>Germany &#40;Opel, Volkswagen, BMW, Audi, Mercedes&#41;;</li>
               <li>France &#40;Peugeot, Citroen, Renault&#41;;</li>
               <li>South Korea &#40;Hyundai, Kia&#41;;</li>
               <li>the USA &#40;Ford&#41;;</li>
               <li>Britain &#40;Mini&#41;;</li>
               <li>Sweden &#40;Volvo&#41;;</li>
               <li>Czechia &#40;Scoda&#41;;</li>
               <li>Romania &#40;Dacia&#41;;</li>
               <li>Italy &#40;Fiat&#41;.</li>
          </ul>
            <br>Some of the manufacturers offer more than one model of hatchback with different accessories &#40;e.g. Seat Leon and Ibiza, Honda Jazz and Civic&#41;. And, of cause, the price will depend on the car complectation.</p>
         <p class="top"><a href="#top" class="read">Back to top</a></p>
         <a id="insurance" class="read"><h3>Car and driver insurance</h3></a><br>
         <p>This point should also be considered when buying any car. In the 21-st century no driver can go on the road without the Compulsory Insurance Certificate at least. As to other types of car insurance you need to check in your country what is more appropriate for your car &#40;Comprehensive Insurance, 3rd Party Insurance, Collision Coverage, Liability Insurance&#41;.</p>
